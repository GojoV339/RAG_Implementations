## Under Construction

Hello My name is Venkata dharaneswara Reddy.
I created this website for my college students to connect them with faculty and Alumini , so they will get the guidance which i never got in my 1st year and 2nd year.
This website will bridge the gap between the comapnies and colleges and in this website the students can pracitice coding and parcticipate in the coding competitions hosted in the campus 
or by the other amrita campuses
