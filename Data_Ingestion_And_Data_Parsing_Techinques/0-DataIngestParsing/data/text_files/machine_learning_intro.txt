    Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and 
    improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following rigid 
    instructions, machine learning models analyze patterns, relationships, and trends in data to make predictions 
    or decisions. It is widely used in applications like image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation 
    systems, autonomous vehicles, and fraud detection. With the growing availability of large datasets and powerful computing 
    resources, machine learning has become one of the most impactful technologies shaping modern industries.
